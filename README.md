## 🧠 Project Overview

Frontend client for my own personal, web-based version of the game **_Hangman_**. This React application provides the user interface for gameplay, communicating with a separate [backend API](https://github.com/jawuanlewis/hangman-api) to manage game state. Players must correctly guess the letters of a given mystery word within 6 attempts. There are 8 available themes of words/phrases for players to guess:

1. Movies
2. Video Games
3. Sports
4. Idioms
5. TV Shows
6. Food
7. Animals
8. Cities

## ⚙️ Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (>=18.0.0)
- **pnpm** — install via `npm install -g pnpm`
- A running instance of the [Hangman API](https://github.com/jawuanlewis/hangman-api) for full functionality

> This is a frontend-only project. Setup instructions are provided below for reference.

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jawuanlewis/hangman-client.git
```

### Install dependencies

```bash
cd hangman-client
pnpm install
```

### Set up environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory that contains the following variable:

- **VITE_API_URL:** URL of the Hangman API (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/api/v1`)

### Run the development server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

## ▶️ Usage

Once the application is running, you can:

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.
2. Start by choosing a level to play.
3. A mystery word will be displayed, along with a keyboard of letters to guess.
4. Guess letters until you either fully reveal the word or lose all 6 attempts.
5. You can either play the same theme/level again or return to the main menu to choose a new one!

## 🔮 Next Steps

### Future Features

- Add a main game page, with no particular theme and an increasing level of difficulty with each word.
- Generate small hints each time the user guesses incorrectly (potentially using OpenAI API).
- Add a multiplayer page.
- Add a "How to Play" page.
